# Having better One-on-Ones

A great tweet from Julia Evans got me thinking about 1:1s. So many of us are exploring the potential of one-on-ones every week. I have personally had some amazing conversations and learned so much from trying different things. I thought I’d capture my journey so far.

1:1s are often my only chance to connect with someone on a regular basis. I enter a 1:1 with the idea that: we are two people, there together, trying to get most out of our time. It is a time to build trust, focus, re-energize, and help each other move forward.

Earlier in my career, I was inspired by Ben Horowitz’s book [*The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205). *He talked about 1:1s as a time to discuss things that don’t fit into status reports:
> *This is the free form meeting for all the pressing issues, brilliant ideas and chronic frustrations that do not fit neatly into status reports, email and other less personal and intimate mechanisms.*

He suggests these are the topics, which given voice can bring the spark to a company. They are also the issues which left unheard, can silently grind a company to a halt. I agree.

He also explored the idea of the 1:1 as the direct report’s meeting, their time to seek help from their manager. This idea excited me, so I experimented and adopted it wholeheartedly. As a manager, I gave my employees full control over the direction of the conversation. As an employee, I had a lot of questions! Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t. Here’s what I found:

As an employee, there were many questions I wanted to ask but didn’t. I wasn’t sure if they were a valuable use of our short time together. Or I knew the answer would require a significant amount of work on my Manager’s side, that probably wasn’t the most important thing for them to be doing. Looking back I wish I had at least written a list of my questions and given them the option of answering.

As a manager, I found that sometimes people struggled to know the questions that would help them the most. Also sometimes, I really just needed to ask people to do things and explain what was needed.

I’m glad I experimented, sometimes it helps to take things a little too far one way, to come back and find a happy medium. Now I take an approach that’s a little more balanced: I think of the 1:1 as a *shared* meeting (seems obvious now!).

Ultimately though, my biggest take away from my 1:1 journey so far is that the best one-on-ones come when there is trust between the two people meeting. When there is trust, a more open and honest discussion follows which normally results in better outcomes for both the employee and manager. I’ve found trust is built by deep and real conversations which flow from great questions. And sometimes a little inspiration helps.

**Questions for managers to ask**

*What are you concerned about from last week? I’m asking because I want to help with it.*

*Is any part of your project unclear or confusing?*

*What should we be doing differently?*

*Do you feel we’re helping you advance your career at a pace you would like?*

*What’s a recent situation you wish you handled differently? What would you change?*

*Who on the team do you have the most difficulty working with? Why?*

*Who do you admire on the team? Why?*

*In our last performance review, we agreed listening was something you’d like to work on. How have you been going with that?*

Many of these come from [Michael Ruggiero’s One-on-one Questions](https://gist.github.com/mjamesruggiero/c17eb4f83789eaa6c835e4984fddb38f), which is inspired by [Jason Evanish’s post](https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/). [Culture Amp also wrote a great post](https://blog.cultureamp.com/great-one-on-one-meeting-questions) that includes many examples. What I like about all of these is that they structure the *categories* of questions you can ask.

Other tips:

Be explicit about your preferred approach to 1:1s. Give your employees permission to move beyond the status report, give them permission to ask questions! Be vulnerable, share things that you are working on.

Open a shared document to jot down notes for the next meeting as they come to mind. This becomes a really important document to keep historical context.

**Questions for employees to ask**

*I’m struggling to prioritize all the things on my plate right now. They are X, Y, Z. What do you think the order should be?*

*Something the team seems to struggle with is … I wondered about trying …… Do you think that would work? Or Something **I **struggle with is …..*

*I’d like to know more information about …. so I could be better at making an informed decision, would you be able to help me?*

*I’d really like to work toward being promoted this year. What are the areas I should focus on improving?*

*I’d like the opportunity to work on ….*

*Something that would help me is ….*

*Something that’s been going really well is …*

*Do you have any concerns about how the project is going?*

*Let’s brainstorm some ideas around that.*

Other tips:

Clarify whether you want advice, action, to brainstorm or just to vent.

I’ve found that revisiting the purpose of 1:1s and getting a list of questions to ask has led to a position where I’m having better 1:1s. Hopefully you can take a couple tips and improve your next 1:1.
