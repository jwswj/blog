# Inclusion — getting the basics right around communication

I feel really passionate about making my workplace inclusive, an environment where everyone is respected and also feels respected. It’s something I never really thought about until joining the workforce and I’m thrilled it’s often a topic of discussion. However looking back, I certainly wasn’t aware that I needed to put effort into doing it.

Since returning to engineering management three months ago, I’ve been reminded of how important communication is in creating that feeling* *of inclusion. It wasn’t emphasized during my education, but creating a culture where everyone feels comfortable to contribute their ideas is so important to what we do.

While inclusion is often talked about with regard to gender, race, or sexual orientation, I think it’s also important to recognize that the way we all communicate with each other everyday has a huge impact. I want to talk about some of the basics that are sometimes overlooked: what better place to start than communication in team meetings and also Github pull requests.

## **Team meetings**

Software engineers can come across as really blunt when giving feedback or responding in team meetings. Of course not *you*, if you’re reading this! You obviously care about developing a circle of trust and purposefully teach rather than tell* *at all times :p

But, because none of us are perfect and sometimes when your product manager has just changed their mind for the third time and the designer tells you “I don’t think it’s that hard”, here are two ways you could respond:

**Scenario 1**

Go with your gut and say exactly what you are feeling “It’s going to take at least a year and we don’t have the right people. End of discussion”.

**Scenario 2**

Take a deep breath, squint a little (it makes you look thoughtful) and say:

*“I don’t quite feel confident around that date, but I can take an action to look into it and come back to you by _______.”*

Silent round of applause. Product manager says “great thanks.” Your team walks away thinking “what a great person, I also agree it’s going to take a while and need to chat with them about it.”

Scenario 1 happens way too frequently in our industry. It limits career progression, causes tension and doesn’t create an environment where people feel free to share their ideas openly. Scenario 2 might not instantly seem appealing, but it will return great results as it gives you an opportunity to guide and influence the conversation.

I asked around Zendesk Product & Engineering for some examples of phrases which have made people cringe (nobody is perfect), and an alternative which could be used:

**Examples**

What gets said: Just read the code

An alternative: *Reading the code is probably the best way to fully understand what’s going on. I’d be happy to walk you through it.*

What gets said: We’ve already got a way of doing that.

An alternative: *I think person X was doing something similar, maybe we should chat to them about any lessons they learned or if there are tools/code we could leverage?*

What gets said: I don’t think it will take that long.

An alternative: *Comparing to X task which the team has done, this Y task seems relatively smaller/bigger. Perhaps we can do a shallow dive and then regather to estimate the work.*

What gets said: I like Jira. It’s here to stay.

An alternative: *In the past we’ve tried quite a few different products, but we’ve kept on ending back at Jira because _____*

What gets said: *Just* file a ticket.

An alternative: *Let me open a ticket for you about that problem so we can track progress on it together.*

Now, I’m not saying we should have scripted team meetings or walk on eggshells around each other. Feel free to make these examples your own and always speak honestly. In your next team meeting, think about whether you are creating a feeling of inclusion and respect. Only in environments like this can we foster sustainable growth.

And now … Github.

## **Github pull requests**

Ah, Github — a delightful wrapper on top of Linus’ git which allows us to work as a globally distributed team. More than that, Github has become the lifeblood of an engineering organization — a place to work through problems, learn from each other and provide feedback to team members. It’s quite magical really, compared to the days of SVN and SourceSafe.

I personally think Pull Requests are one of the best tools we have for learning and educating in our industry. Heck, it might have even taken over from hitting the right mouse button and clicking view source, or reading a Stack Overflow answer.

But I’m often disappointed by the approach taken by engineers in providing feedback, both internally with their peers and especially on Open Source projects. And I’m not sure we even know we’re doing it!

Scenario’s I’ve seen play out:

**Scenario 1 — New hire** **starts**

They are writing a new programming language and use tabs instead of spaces[1]. *Instantly* the first feedback on Github is a succinct “spaces, not tabs” … and nothing else. No link to the internal style guide, no comment on the actual logic which has been written. It’s like rocking up to a party, knocking on the door, and being told you obviously didn’t read the dress code, before having the door slammed in your face.

**Scenario 2 — Woman contributing to an open source project**

Recently, I was chatting to a phenomenal software engineer who described to me how she had removed all traces of gender from her public Github profile. When I asked her why, she said it was because she found that the open source community provided such demeaning feedback. She wondered if this was this because she was a woman? Or because Github responses generally come across as really negative? There was some research into the impact of gender on Github in 2016 which showed that women were more likely to have their Pull Requests merged if their profile wasn’t identifiable as female[2]. I’ll be interested to hear her results.

**Scenario 3 — Someone wants to try something different**

A contributor sees a different way of doing things that could change/improve. Instantly a defensive mechanism kicks in from owners without seemingly even considering the idea. Pull Request closed. Not even a comment as to why it isn’t being considered.

Why can people be so negative on Github? We might be able to get some insight from other electronic written forms. In the world of emails it is widely accepted that the receiver tends to interpret an email in a more negative tone than the sender intended it. For example, if the sender thinks the email is positive, the receiver will view it as neutral. If the sender thinks the email is neutral, the receiver tends to view it as negative. In other words, there is natural negative skew when the receiver doesn’t have a chance to read body language or tone of voice. It’s probably fair to assume the same is true for Github.

But with a little effort, we can improve the digital extension of our physical workplace as well as our online community. Some examples:

**Examples**

What gets said on Github: We’ve already proved that fails.

How our negative bias could interprets this: You are stupid and don’t deserve an explanation.

An alternative: *We have tried ____ and found ______. Here is link to a Pull Request which has a good discussion which is worth reading. Try _____ instead.*

What gets said on Github: This is wrong.

How our negative bias could interprets this: You are always wrong.

An alternative: *I don’t feel this is heading in the right direction because _____.*

What gets said on Github: we don’t do it that way here.

How our negative bias could interprets this: You don’t fit in and I don’t have time to help you or use capital letters at the start of sentences.

An alternative: *This is a tricky area of the codebase and I can see where you are going, but unfortunately I think it follows a different pattern than we prefer here. Let’s pair on this during the afternoon so we can wrap it up by the time we go home.*

What gets said on Github: Prefer _____.

How our negative bias could interprets this: What you have done is wrong, and you should do it this other way.

An alternative: *This a common pattern, however I’ve come to prefer _____ over _____ because of _____.*

It may seem frustrating that responses are interpreted with this negative bias but when we start to recognise it we can communicate in a way that conveys our actual intention.

Try out the following:

* Convey a positive tone: Throw a ❤️ around. Feel silly? Don’t worry the negative bias will kick in and instantly subdue your tone to helpful and supportive.

* Explain the value of the task: “I know it’s different to the way other companies do it but one of our core values is consistency.”

* Talk about progress: “Great work on ______. If you get it working it will be a valuable solution for _____.”

* Just simply say thank you: “Thanks for exploring a fix for this.”

* Add positive comments to things you like about parts of the code, it goes a long way towards establishing friendly tone: “So easy to read. Love it.”

* And importantly, always share your honest thoughts.

Inclusion starts with getting the basics right around the way we communicate with each other in-person and online. I think it’s important to recognise that the workplace extends to the tools we use and we want everyone to feel comfortable to contribute, explore ideas and learn across all mediums.
